## 📌 Introduction

amFOSS Freshers Flutter Curriculum Task.

## 🏃‍ Getting Started

- You guys know very well how to fork, clone and start working with a github repo :smile:

- For getting more information about the task build the app and navigate to the task button present in the container containing your image and name.

- For task-solution submission it is obvious that you have to make a PR by checking out to a branch of your name but you also have to make the solution button present in the container containing your image and name navigate to the screen you made for solving the issue.

## 📝 Note

Show your creativity and feel free to make a creative and good looking UI. We should not see the same UI we showed in the demo. :smiling_imp: Also, no two members should have same UI.

## 📋 Additional Information

The best looking UI will get a sponsored trip to mars from Sujith (in collab with SpaceX). :alien:

## TO ADD : 
- Link the API which I generated using Postman for refreshing token
- Request API for a session on the Line Graph implemented
